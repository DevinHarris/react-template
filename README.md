# React Template starter.

> In this starter template, you'll find an easy to get started way of creating React apps. The reason I created this is because while working with React itself is great, the setup and configuration is not.

> This template is easily customizable and you can add and remove things to fit your project.

> Techologies in this stack:

    1. React
    2. Webpack
    3. NPM Scripts
    	1. `"build": "webpack"`: Compiles your code down to code Modern Browsers understand.
    	2. `"pro-build"`: "webpack -p": Same as `"build": "webpack"`, but builds for production
    	3. "dev": "webpack-dev-server": Spins up Webpack Dev Server.
    	4. "ext-dev": "webpack-dev-server --host 0.0.0.0": Spins up Weback Dev Server, but can be accessed from external devices connected to your network.
    4. Sass (SCCS)
